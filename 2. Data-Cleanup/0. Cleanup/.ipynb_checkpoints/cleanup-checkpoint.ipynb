    "3. Create column categorizations to filter dataset for relevant purposes\n",
    "4. Break down receiver into its individual row\n",
    "5. Create playmaker column, and check id uniqueness - check that one ID corresponds to one name\n",
    "6. Flag non-relevant plays - add a binary column that flags 1 for run, pass, reception, FG/XP, 0 for all others\n",
    "7. Add any additional stat needed - reception (for plays that fall under 'reception'), target ('reception', 'pass')\n",
    "8. Add position based off of the highest stat of a player. Position will be refined later with web scraping\n",
    "9. Ensure that stat are correctly represented for a given position\n",
    "10. Verify top 50 stats against the reported ones\n"
