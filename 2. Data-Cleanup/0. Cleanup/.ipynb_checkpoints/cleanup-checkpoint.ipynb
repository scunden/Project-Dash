    "2. Merge game file to add in week identifier to the new dataset (games.csv is in '1. Additional Data File')\n",
    "3. Create column categorizations to filter dataset for relevant purposes\n",
    "4. Break down receiver into its individual row\n",
    "5. Create playmaker column, and check id uniqueness - check that one ID corresponds to one name\n",
    "6. Flag non-relevant plays - add a binary column that flags 1 for run, pass, reception, FG/XP, 0 for all others\n",
    "7. Add any additional stat needed - reception (for plays that fall under 'reception'), target ('reception', 'pass')\n",
    "8. Add position based off of the highest stat of a player. Position will be refined later with web scraping\n",
    "9. Ensure that stat are correctly represented for a given position\n",
    "10. Verify top 50 stats against the reported ones\n"
